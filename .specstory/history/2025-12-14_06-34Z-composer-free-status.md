| Web Search Results |  | As of December 2025, Composer, the AI coding assistant developed by Cursor, offers a free tier with limited access. The free plan includes 2,000 code completions and 50 "slow" agent requests per month, suitable for occasional use. For more extensive usage, the Pro plan is available at $20 per month (or $16 per month when billed annually), providing unlimited basic completions and approximately 500 "fast" agent requests. The Business plan, priced at $40 per user per month, offers the same usage per seat along with team management features. An Ultra plan is also available at $200 per month, offering approximately 20 times the Pro usage (around 10,000 fast agent actions) with priority access. Composer is included at no extra cost in all tiers, including the free tier, albeit with some limitations. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40leucopsis/composer-a-fast-new-ai-coding-model-by-cursor-e1a023614c07?utm_source=openai))<br/><br/>For developers seeking free AI coding assistance, several alternatives are available:<br/><br/>- **GitHub Copilot**: Offers a free tier with limited features, including 2,000 completions and 50 chat requests monthly. The Pro plan, at $10 per month, provides unlimited completions and access to advanced models.

If I use auto, will it choose composer since it's free most of the time?

| Web Search Results |  | In Cursor IDE, the "Auto" mode dynamically selects the most suitable AI model for your task, typically choosing from premium models like `claude-4-sonnet`, `claude-4-opus`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, and `gpt-4.1`. ([forum.cursor.com](https://forum.cursor.com/t/documentation-inconsistency-auto-mode-limit-handling-needs-clarification/117401?utm_source=openai))<br/><br/>For users on the free Hobby plan, access to premium models is limited. Therefore, when using Auto mode, the system may default to available free models, such as Cursor Small, Deepseek Models (V3.1, V3, R1), GPT-4o mini, and Grok 3 Mini. ([cursorideguide.com](https://cursorideguide.com/guides/cursor-model-comparison?utm_source=openai))<br/><br/>To customize model selection for specific tasks, you can manually choose a model for each mode (e.g., Ask, Plan, Implement) within the Cursor settings. This allows you to assign different models to different tasks, enhancing your workflow efficiency. ([forum.cursor.com](https://forum.cursor.com/t/choose-a-model-for-each-mode/144474?utm_source=openai))<br/><br/>Upgrading to a paid plan, such as Pro ($20/month), provides unlimited Tab completions, unlimited Auto mode requests, and $20/month credit for premium models. This upgrade grants access to a broader range of AI models and features, enhancing your development experience.

| Web Search Results |  | Cursor's Auto mode is designed to automatically select the most suitable AI model for your task, considering factors like task complexity, model availability, performance requirements, and cost considerations. ([cursorideguide.com](https://cursorideguide.com/guides/cursor-model-comparison?utm_source=openai))<br/><br/>In the free Hobby plan, Auto mode primarily utilizes models that are available without additional cost, such as Cursor Small and Deepseek Models. This approach ensures that users can benefit from AI assistance without incurring extra charges. ([cursorideguide.com](https://cursorideguide.com/guides/cursor-model-comparison?utm_source=openai))<br/><br/>However, it's important to note that while Auto mode aims to optimize for cost, the free tier does have usage limitations. For instance, the Hobby plan includes up to 2,000 code completions and 50 slow premium model requests per month. Once these limits are reached, access to certain features may be restricted until the next billing cycle. ([cursor.com](https://www.cursor.com/pricing?utm_source=openai))<br/><br/>To maximize the benefits of Auto mode within the free tier, consider the following strategies:<br/><br/>- **Monitor Usage:** Regularly check your usage statistics to stay within the provided limits.<br/><br/>- **Prioritize Tasks:** Use AI assistance for tasks where it adds the most value, reserving manual efforts for simpler tasks.<br/><br/>- **Explore Model Options:** Familiarize yourself with the models available in Auto mode to understand their capabilities and limitations.<br/><br/>By being mindful of these factors, you can effectively utilize Cursor's Auto mode in the free tier while managing costs and optimizing your development workflow. |

Auto mode considers cost and availability. On the free tier, it prioritizes free models, but Composer isn’t necessarily the default.

On the free Hobby plan, Auto typically uses:
- Cursor Small
- Deepseek Models (V3.1, V3, R1)
- GPT-4o mini
- Grok 3 Mini

Composer is included in the free tier, but Auto selects based on task complexity and model capabilities, not just cost. It may choose Composer for some tasks, but it’s not guaranteed to be the primary choice.

To use Composer more often, set it manually in Cursor settings for specific modes (Ask, Plan, Implement) instead of relying on Auto.
